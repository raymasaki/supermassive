### Approach
	- Started with brainstorming.

	- Built universal parts of backend.
	- Searched for and tested APIs to see what were both attainable and true to the original vision of the project.
	- Divided labor between focusing on database reading and writing, front end, implementing the APIâ€™s properly, creating favorites and trending features.
	- Made individual features in test apps before adding them into the main production app.
	- Pulled together different branches of work to create a working prototype.
	- Integrated front end and polished design.
	- Put site through QA to make sure it is feature rich and bug free.

### Unresolved Problems/Cut Features
	- Did not get to implement command for turning on random API after choosing a type of post
	- Did not get to implement commands for choosing type of post for random search
	- Did not get to allow members to delete their favorites
	- Did not get to allow members to have a profile image

### Major Hurdles
	- Successfully implementing APIs: we tried Youtube, Vimeo, Twitter, Imgur, Vine and Instagram before getting the current APIs to work
	- Implementing Trending feature: we had difficulty incrementing the counting value for documents on a repeated search, we discovered findOneAndUpdate which solved this problem
	- Implementing Favorites feature: we had difficulty assigning a favorite to a specific User, we created a route that brought the current user id to app.js, which let us assign that value to the Favorite documents and get them from the database based on that id value
